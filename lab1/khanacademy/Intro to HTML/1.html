    <h1>Songs</h1>
    
    <h2>Love like you</h2>
    
    <p> 
        If I could begin to be <br>
    Half of what you think of me <br>
    I could do about anything <br>
    I could even learn how to love <br> 
    When I see the way you act <br>
    Wondering when I'm coming back <br>
    I could do about anything <br>
    I could even learn how to love <br>
    Like you
    </p>
